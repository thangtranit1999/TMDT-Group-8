Andrea just loves life and the little things that are available to enjoy this. From motorbikes, fishing, enjoying a coffee with colleagues to general helping customers and colleagues alike, Andrea is there. He studied computer science at the University of Catania and graduated in 2011. He grew up in Acireale on the Italian island of Sicily with his brother and parents.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúHere we have all you want: the sea and mountains, people are kind (almost always haha) and enjoy a good climate, even during the winter. There are wonderful places to see, if you&#8217;ve never been here you have to take a trip around here, maybe by motorbike‚Ä¶ Sicily is the place I call home, having also lived in Catanzaro (Calabria) and for a couple of months in Milan (Lombardia).‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Andrea started working at YITH in 2013‚Ä¶ making him one of the longest-serving developers in the company. Before this, it was not a straightforward start to becoming a developer‚Ä¶</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúIn 2012, after I did several work-experiences coming out of university, I shortly worked in Calabria for a startup which I really enjoyed. Unfortunately, it all ended in January 2013. In the meantime, I accepted position as a substitute at school for a computer-science teacher at the Hotel Institute of Catania. Luckily, my cousin introduced me to Nando, the CEO of YITH. He had just finished the offices in Aci Saint Antonio and was looking for collaborators. After a brief interview, Nando asked me to join the company and I felt right at home from the beginning. This was in 2013 and as you see, this adventure continues today :-)‚Äù</p></blockquote>

Traveling to WordCamps is a great way to meet many customers and for them to connect with the team.</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, the team likes to stick to set times working together. It gives a sense of teamwork and joined achievement. Also, Andrea can be found working in the Sicilian office on most days. What does a typical workday look like?</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúI start work at 9 &#8216;o&#8217;clock. Before that, I spend 15 minutes checking emails and other little tasks that my colleagues send me. After that, I manage the support requests for the rest of the morning. After lunch, I work on a different project. Plugins update, bug fixing, and improvement, new plugins or projects, ideas that arise during our weekly meetings &#8230; there is no shortage of work, you can always find something to do!‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>What else is important in your job you do today?</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúI like writing code so I like my job but at YITH it is different. I have full control of the project I&#8217;m working on, I can study it, find the solution, and implement it according to what I think is the best solution/technology at the moment!‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlso, the coffee and lunch breaks! It&#8217;s an important moment in the working day. During this moment you can talk with colleagues and share about life or about something that is not linked to our jobs&#8230; it&#8217;s a good moment! Unfortunately, the Covid-19 emergency has stolen this from us, though we are confident, we will have these moments again soon!‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Customer support is a big part of most developers‚Äô daily tasks. This gets the highest priority and getting appreciated is something that most developers find very important. No surprise that Andrea takes great care in making sure the customer is valued and a solution is found quickly and when this gratitude is returned if feels great.</p>
<blockquote><p>¬†‚ÄúWe try to be professional but friendly with customers, this is what makes our job special. A great show of gratitude is when a customer opens a support request simply to say &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221; or to communicate an achieved success or to know if we are safe during this bad period. I think this is truly special.<br />
In general, we try to create a family atmosphere, both with colleagues but in particular with customers. With colleagues, the relationship is realy very good! With many of them, we also socialize outside of work.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Andrea is the main author of <a href="https://yithemes.com/themes/plugins/yith-woocommerce-multi-vendor/">YITH WooCommerce Multi-Vendor</a> or the marketplace plugin for WooCommerce. But this is just one of a big list of projects that Andrea has been involved with. For him, the biggest challenge is to plan for unknown future improvements.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúYou must always analyze and plan everything before starting to write code. Think about how the software could evolve in the future because it is impossible to think of adding everything immediately, but you know customers will come up with some amazing and useful features. A plugin is something¬† that will grow and evolve over time.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the regular questions of what food that gets Andrea motivated the most is ‚Äòanything cooked on the grill‚Äô but suggest a pineapple on pizza and he will tell you ‚Äòit‚Äôs a crime‚Äô&#8230; we should have known this when asking an Italian. Back to what Andrea loves the most‚Ä¶</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúMotorbike! I like to ride a motorbike! I love to travel and discover new places by motorbike, in my opinion, it is something wonderful. I also like fishing, hiking in the mountains, going to the sea. I really love DIY and gardening too! Pretty much everything that involves spending time outdoors, and even better the Sicilian outdoors! ‚Äù</p></blockquote>

<p>When started using WooCommerce and have added products showing on the front-end but you do not allow visitors to purchase them, you can disable the native WooCommerce cart and checkout in a simple click. Also if you prefer, you can hide the prices from being displayed to visitors. Depending on the plugin and if this is a free or the premium version, you can adjust many more settings. Some people also refer to this type of solution as an e-commerce brochure site, if it is a more permanent solution. Let‚Äôs dive a little deeper into different problems it can solve.</p>
<p>So let‚Äôs start with 5 very good user scenarios whereby you would want to use a catalog mode plugin for WooCommerce.</p>
<ol>
<li>The store is populated but not ready to sell. Starting and populating a new shop and you are waiting to finalize pricing and the payment methods? By having the product pages live, it can help with getting the sitemap indexed by Google or share them on social media to create interest</li>
<li>A temporary online store closure; holidays or due to unforeseen circumstances like the corona outbreak. You can simply display a message with more details instead of the ‚Äòadd to cart‚Äô button.</li>
<li>External link but with a custom CTA; like a rental site with an external booking platform</li>
<li>Only logged in customers can make a purchase, though every visitor can see the products. Also referred to as a trade or wholesale site that requires some kind of application to allow customers to see the pricing and checkout.</li>
<li>Your products are custom made or are no longer for sale; for example, when artisan crafters have created custom pieces of furniture or jewelry and showcase these to inspire the next customer to get in touch.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just 5 examples and we‚Äôve seen many more use cases, making this the must-have plugin to have for every WooCommerce site, whether this is enabled or disabled to use when you need it.</p>

<h3>What are the key features of the Free version of YITH WooCommerce Catalog Mode?</h3>
<p>The most important feature you can do ‚Äòout of the box‚Äô which is to turn your WooCommerce store into a brochure. This covers the first two user-cases and disables your cart and checkout pages.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1117555 aligncenter" src="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/catalog-mode-002.jpg" alt="" width="699" height="405" srcset="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/catalog-mode-002.jpg 1678w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/catalog-mode-002-300x174.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/catalog-mode-002-1024x594.jpg 1024w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/catalog-mode-002-768x445.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/catalog-mode-002-1536x891.jpg 1536w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/catalog-mode-002-500x290.jpg 500w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/catalog-mode-002-440x255.jpg 440w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/catalog-mode-002-261x151.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/catalog-mode-002-311x180.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/catalog-mode-002-363x210.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/catalog-mode-002-270x157.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /></p>
<p>For many store owners, this is what you need it most for, to stop online orders. But remain visible with all products, categories and archive pages, there to be seen. Seen by actual visitors but also bots (Google Indexing) and linking from referral sites.<br />
Just ‚Äòout of the box‚Äô, WooCommerce has a great structure to manage taxonomies (categories and tags) there are many scenarios whereby you only need to install WooCommerce and the YITH WooCommerce Catalog Mode plugin, to manage a whole new type of online ‚Äòstores‚Äô, service providers and galleries. Think of art, custom products, inspirational fashion images, party providers, and more unique products and services that most people will not buy with an online checkout without making some serious inquiries.</p>
<div class="center-block"><a class="download-link" title="Download File" href="https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/yith-woocommerce-catalog-mode.zip">Download for free</a></div>
<p>Both the free and the <a href="https://yithemes.com/themes/plugins/yith-woocommerce-catalog-mode/">premium version</a> allows you to hide the ‚Äòadd to cart‚Äô button or replace this with a different text. It could link to a contact or booking form for example. Asking yourself what you want to achieve, not all solutions need a plugin.</p>
<h3>Create a WooCommerce brochure without a plugin</h3>
<p>It gets better as you can hide the ‚Äúadd to cart‚Äù button with a simple line of code. Add the following code to the functions.php<br />

<h3>Added functionality that comes with the premium features</h3>
<p>Most likely you will get used to the flexibility of the different functions the free plugin offers and want something more. For example, what if you need to set separate rules that do not apply all visitors or products? Then it makes so much more sense to use the premium version.</p>

You can set rules that set the catalog mode for a specific category or tag only. A great usage example would be that if you are planning to sell remnants on a specific day, but want to list the products so people can browse. In this way, you can create a huge demand for the items and give everyone a fair chance to buy them on the day. All you need to do is to remove the rule you‚Äôve set up and everything is available to be purchased.</p>

<p>By enabling it for guest users, you can use any contact form to create an application form to recruit trade buyers to shop from you. A super simple way to create a wholesale or trade buying website.</p>
<p>Other options including selecting catalog mode for certain categories, tags, and products, but also the location and of course the logged out users only.<br />

<p>Creating an inquiry form is super easy now and even better when you connect it with your favorite form builder. Just imagine the possibilities when you add conditional fields, image uploads, and more‚Ä¶ the options are limitless to make a brochure site into a landing page and lead-capture, whilst using the WooCommerce structure and layout.<br />
The plugin has been integrated with Contact Form 7, Gravity Forms, Formidable Forms, and Ninja Forms. So adding a form to each of the products you can send the specific inquiry straight to you or even a third party, depending on the rules you set up. This can work for sites that show custom-made of hand-made products and the artist or professional would need to discuss more details. But also this could work for a house rental site and the visitor can get in touch with the home-owner directly.</p>
<p>The options with the Catalog Mode for WooCommerce are endless and it should really be a base-plugin for so many types of businesses and something you can just enable when you need it.</p>
<p>Like all YITH plugins, YITH WooCommerce Catalog Mode works with all plugins and in particular the <a href="https://yithemes.com/themes/plugins/yith-woocommerce-request-a-quote/">Request a Quote for WooCommerce</a>, <a href="https://yithemes.com/themes/plugins/yith-woocommerce-multi-vendor/">Multi-Vendor</a> and <a href="https://yithemes.com/themes/plugins/yith-woocommerce-product-bundles/">Product Bundles.</a></p>

From 4-6 June 2020, we should all have gathered in Porto for another edition of the increasingly successful WordCamp Europe. Instead, due to the outbreak, we were able to join in virtually. The team had plenty of notice to make this happen, but still, planning is one thing and to pull it off is another thing.</p>

<h2>What is WordCamp Europe?</h2>
<p>A WordCamp is an event where loads of WordPress users, companies, speakers, and everything in-between, come together for a few days and share knowledge. Often this is combined with a contributor day on which WordPress users can help to make WordPress as an opensource platform better. Contributions can be made to the code, translations, support, documentation, and community to name just a few areas.<br />
These types of events can be held in any city, country or also on a continent. In Europe, it is a tradition for this to be held once a year in a different city and country. Last year, WordCamp Europe was held in Berlin for example.</p>
<h2>Why does YITH sponsors WordCamps?</h2>
<p>Sponsoring a WordCamp is more than just adding your logo and brand to a prominent place or to sell more. Actually, we see very little immediate results from sponsoring WordCamps. But we have learned over the years that this is not the type of event to set any expectations other than sharing knowledge, joy, and making lots of friends. Yes, we take part and sponsor to make WordPress a nicer and more inclusive community. Obviously, we do share some information about our company and are there to answer any questions. We firmly believe in building up a relationship with users and the wider community and somehow this always comes back and reflects in a happy and stable customer base.</p>
<h2>We did not share swag but knowledge instead.</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been to a WordCamp before and bumped into our sponsor stand, you&#8217;ve probably received an iconic YITH swag t-shirt. A bit more difficult in a virtual world, although a virtual t-shirt does not fade or shrink in the wash, so we opted for a session with a presentation. As our community and partnership manager, I had the honor to share some company history, a presentation on &#8217;10 ways to identify opportunities for every WooCommerce store&#8217;, and followed by a Q&amp;A.<br />
The sponsor&#8217;s area had three main zoom rooms that could be accessed by the attendees. Each sponsor had an allocated time to use as a platform to do all sorts of activities, including quizzes, demonstrations, AMA sessions, presentations, and more.</p>

<h2>The talks and speakers</h2>
<p>Two tracks were dedicated to the speakers and their talks both on Friday and Saturday. The talks ranged from topics including GDPR, accessibility, dark mode, project management, and WordPress coding. But no doubt most people tuned in to see Matt Mullenweg on Friday evening in a down-to-earth Q&amp;A session with Mattias.</p>
<p><iframe title="WordCamp Europe 2020 Online Track 1 (Friday)" width="1140" height="641" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/df3Nx1vyswU?start=16235&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Watch the Q&amp;A session here again that starts with a demo of the latest Gutenberg developed features that are coming out soon.<br />
<a href="https://2020.europe.wordcamp.org/schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The schedule</a> is up on the website and you can follow the links to any of the talks and watch them again on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaYQGYDpXpU4A17kxN-AgJQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>We normally give you a list of notable speakers you should watch again, but this is so difficult to choose from. Of the talks I watched, every one has some valuable advice or gives you some food for thought.</p>
<p>Track 2 on Friday is one of those line-ups that included talks that look beyond WordPress and what it is today. Like Miriam Schwab&#8217;s talk about cutting-edge development or David Lockie who talks about using AI in WordPress. Also, on track one about &#8216;WordPress performance trends&#8217; by Hristo Pandjarov is something that people have to deal with at some point. So trust us, take a look and skip through the talks for something that grabs your interest.</p>
<h2>The experience as an attendee</h2>
<p>Many of us at YITH joined in with some of the talks and presentations, but from a personal view as an attendee, I have a few comments.<br />
Knowing that you can watch the talks days later, is a great comfort. Initially, the times clashed with family life as for example watching Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s talk was not what my kids had in mind as a Friday-evening treat with popcorn.<br />
Whilst I communicated with as many fellow sponsors and attendees as possible, I could not manage to view the talks at the same time either, so having them available instantly in the hours and days after the event is a great way.</p>
<p>What most of us missed was the interaction with friends and fellow WordPressers like you do at a &#8216;normal&#8217; WordCamp. Even the digital Zoom rooms do not make up for it, though great fun. Many attendees were reluctant to enter &#8216;sponsor booths&#8217; which is completely understandable. This is something very new and unusual but who knows this will be the norm in the future.</p>
<p>After every WordCamp is it usual to digest all the information the days afterward in your mind, as each experience is very intense in a good way with lots of inspiration. Something that didn&#8217;t happen to me following a virtual event, but instead there is so much more to gain in the days and weeks ahead and we&#8217;d encourage you to watch the talks again, contact sponsors and engage in conversations or ask questions.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1132091 aligncenter" src="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-06-at-19.51.55-e1591715735417.png" alt="" width="800" height="500" /></p>
<p>And finally&#8230; Thank you to the amazing organizers for keeping such a tight schedule and all tracks, rooms, sponsor areas flowing throughout the event. It is so easy to get it wrong, but you did great. There is only one more thing to say. We really hope to see you for real at the next WordCamp Europe in Porto in 2021.</p>

He makes sure that the main website runs smoothly as well as many other projects. Apart from development he also looks after the training for the company, a hugely vital role central to YITH, but who is Francesco and how did he join the company?</p>
<p>Just to confuse matters more, his colleagues don‚Äôt call him Francesco but Ciccio for two reasons. Firstly, this is a nickname given to him since he was a small child, and secondly, there are a few other team members with a very similar name.</p>
<p>So let‚Äôs find out about Francesco ‚ÄòCiccio‚Äô Grasso‚Äôs life at YITH</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúI initially worked as a computer system engineer, then as a freelance developer and finally I joined YITH. The company organized a free training course on WordPress development back in 2013. At the end of the course, the best students faced a trial period with the prospect of being hired permanently.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter an initial phase of training in the company, I was entrusted with a large and ambitious project as a stress test. I was well followed and learned a lot from that project. Now I take care of following the development of the company&#8217;s main site and other important projects. I also review the frontend of many of our projects.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Describe a typical working day from start to finish.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe typical day begins with a tour on the wordpress.org forums of the theme and plugins that I develop. Then I go to check the ongoing projects and tasks on asana. After that, I dive into the development of the current project. During the day there is no lack of opportunities for several video calls with colleagues to update us.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>What is the best moment of the day?</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúEarly in the morning, when I am fully focused on the project I am following. I also really appreciate the update calls on the projects in progress with Nando and Sara because they have always excellent ideas for making important improvements and changes.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>How do you describe the relationship with your colleagues?</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúEach colleague of YITH is special in a different way. I am fortunate to have colleagues whom I have known for many years before joining the company. And many new friends that I can truly call friends.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Francesco‚Äôs main responsibility is looking after yithemes.com as the company‚Äôs theme developer he is also the proud author of the Proteo project. This is a WooCommerce optimized theme that is freely available from wordpress.org. Both projects face many challenges on a daily basis and in the words of Ciccio: ‚Äúthere is always something to learn. Training is a process that never ends if you are ambitious.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote><p>‚Äúyithemes.com is always a challenge because we must bring the maximum of current technology but at the same time not introduce breaking changes that could confuse the user during the process of choosing and purchasing our products.</p>
<p>Proteo is our great return to the WordPress theme market. In this case, cleanliness of the code and compliance with all WP policies are the top priority.‚Äù</p></blockquote>

<p>Francesco lives in Acireale, a baroque city in Sicily. An island in the middle of the Mediterranean sea and often referred to as ‚Äòthe cradle of many civilizations‚Äô. Francesco was the lead organizer of last year‚Äôs WordCamp Catania with arguably the youngest attendee.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúI live with my wife and our little son Salvatore. (fun fact: I think it was one of the smallest participants of <a href="https://yithemes.com/blog/events/wordcamp-catania-2019-simply-in-our-heart/">WordCamp Catania</a> since it was in mom&#8217;s belly when I organized the WordCamp Catania 2019!)</p>
<p>Dividing between work from home and he is always complicated because he is very attached to me, but we are finding good compromises <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I followed a course in computer science, though not graduated from the university, I think I have passed the many tests that life has thrown at me as a developer. (who knows, maybe one day I will decide to do it &#8230; I only need a few exams to complete it).</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you have any other passions and hobbies?</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúComputers, drawing, movies, travels, and since a couple of months photography‚Ä¶‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>What food gets you motivated and makes you hungry thinking about it?</p>
<blockquote><p>All Italian food is good <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Difficult to find something that is not <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, what do you think about Pizza with pineapple?</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúNo, no, no, no&#8230; it&#8217;s a crime!‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Francesco has been an employee for over 7 years and has seen the company through different stages. Francesco has been to many WordCamps and was also booked to go to WordCamp Europe in June 2020. Due to the Corona outbreak, this now takes place virtually, but there is no doubt that you will see ‚ÄòCiccio‚Äô at many more future WordCamps representing YITH in our iconic green shirts.

<h2>What is a WooCommerce Wishlist plugin?</h2>



<p><br />Most of the bigger e-commerce businesses have a wishlist feature available. This is not by accident as they can see the value and the returns it can offer. So what a wishlist plugin?</p>



<p>Adding a bit of software to your WooCommerce and WordPress installation can add some great functionality and also in the case of a wishlist.</p>



<p>A wishlist plugin allows a customer to compile a custom list of favorite products that they can select, and quite literally, ‚Äòadd to a digital wishlist‚Äô.</p>



<p>Some of the key benefits of this type of functionality are;</p>



<ul>
<li>A customer can create one or more lists and organizes them based on their subjects</li>
<li>The customer might decide to wait to purchase a product until a later date or is indecisive.</li>
<li>You can get a customer to register well before they go through checkout.</li>
<li>Being able to share or see a friend‚Äôs wishlist</li>
<li>A number of other benefits depending on the type of solution you choose.</li>
</ul>



<p>Although we talk about a wishlist, this can also be renamed as ‚Äòfavorites‚Äô or ‚Äòsaved items‚Äô Whether you use a ‚Äòheart icon‚Äô or a star, it is completely open to you and what your customers favor most.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The key features any wishlist plugin should have.</h2>



<p><br />Some things are absolutely key to any wishlist plugin to make it good for the customer and some are must-haves for the retailer to make it a good investment. So to split them up.<br /><br /></p>



<p><strong>Important features for the user;<br /><br /></strong></p>



<ul>
<li>To be able to save a product to a wishlist; of course the most important feature, but consider how it looks and behaves from a customer‚Äôs point of view. We&#8217;d recommend this next to the &#8216;buy now&#8217; button.</li>
<li>Create new wishlists, name them, and also delete them; most people would want to be in control of the different lists, whether it is for a birthday or parts for a particular car. Allowing some control and management is key. <br />Adding a link from the header section allows for quick navigation to the wishlists.</li>
<li>Share a wishlist with contacts using social media and WhatsApp; share it with friends for a wedding gift list or birthday list or to remind yourself via email‚Ä¶ social sharing is what is expected.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong><br />Key features for the WooCommerce store owner;<br /><br /></strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Display options for the ‚Äòadd to wishlist‚Äô button; most important, but also think about where this is located and what the button looks like.</li>
<li>Add an ‚ÄòAdd to Cart‚Äô button in the wishlist; once it is on the wishlist, add the item to the cart for a quick checkout.</li>
<li>Customizable button for ‚Äòadd to wishlist‚Äô with Ajax loading; Do you want it to display a star or a heart icon? Or just the word ‚Äòadd to favorites‚Äô? Maybe show a confirmation message, as well as the option to remove it from the wishlist</li>
</ul>

				 Create an &#8216;Add to wishlist&#8217; button with a less prominent style (color, size) than the &#8216;add to cart&#8217; button. You don&#8217;t want it to be more important than the buy now or add to cart button. Use the standard heart icon and not a very weird icon because users can&#8217;t understand that a pencil icon or a beer bottle icon is a wishlist option. Same for a star icon, as it can be confused with &#8216;reviews&#8217;.             </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>It is vital to check these features before you install a plugin. It is not uncommon that users install any plugin that appears in the list and only to realize it is not quite ticking every single requirement.</p>
<p><br />You can <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/yith-woocommerce-wishlist/">download the free wishlist plugin </a>from here.¬†from wordpress.org Therefore, understand what your key features are, what the potential could be when choosing the right plugin.</p>

<h2>Advanced Wishlist for WooCommerce features;</h2>



<p><br />The basic wishlist functionality is suitable for most shop owners, but once you understand the potential of it, you almost feel like missing out. And with that, I mean, losing out on revenue. A great wishlist plugin should give your customers the extra options they soon will get used to. Amazon has completely mastered the wishlist solution and often users get disappointed if they can not find the same features in another shop.</p>



<p><strong>Important wishlist features for the user:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>To be able to save a product to a different wishlist; you might have 2 or even 20 different types of wishlist.</li>
<li>Create new wishlists, name them, and also delete them; the different wishlists should be managed independently and named, change settings and delete them to start with.</li>
<li>Being able to share them with contacts using social media and WhatsApp; most first interactions happen from a phone, yet the conversion and revenue do not always represent this. It means that people checkout on a desktop or at a later stage. Creating a wishlist and sharing this with a friend or even yourself seems vital and WhatsApp is the easiest solution.</li>
<li>Remove items or automatically remove them once added to the cart; you don‚Äôt want to see the items that you‚Äôve already purchased, so they should be taken out of your wishlist.</li>
<li>Being able to view someone else‚Äôs wishlist; as previously mentioned when someone else shares their list, you‚Äôd like to see it. Or maybe not by making it private</li>
<li>Add variation of the product to a wishlist; adding jeans to your wishlist and then when checking out, you need to add the size‚Ä¶ not a great user experience, so being able to add the variations of the product is an important feature.</li>
<li>Many more ‚Äònice to have‚Äô features like ‚Äòask for a quote‚Äô, rearranging the order, and being able to see price changes.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong><br />Key wishlist features for the WooCommerce store owner;<br /><br /></strong></p>



<ul>
<li>View the most popular products in wishlists; this can be a great piece of market-research for any store owner.</li>
<li>Send out promotions to those with a particular product in a wishlist; being able to target a small segment of your customers is a really useful and targeted marketing and sales strategy with a much higher success rate.</li>
<li>Customize different layouts with price, image, and add to basket rules for frictionless checkout; maybe you prefer large images in a grid layout or prefer it to be displayed in a list? Different types of shops have different requirements and preferences.</li>
<li>Wishlist search of all public wishlists for social interaction; if your products allow your users to create a nicely curated list that you like other users to see, then this is a super useful feature. Imagine a package holiday or a music playlist.</li>
</ul>



<p>The list of useful features can easily be extended by another 20 points with different scenario‚Äôs but as every business is different, you get the idea that a premium wishlist offers many tools for the business owner to drive traffic and revenue.</p>

<h2>Get the most out of any wishlist for WooCommerce</h2>



<p><br />Here are two business cases whereby you should really use the wishlist functionality.</p>



<p>A store aiming for families, whether this is for clothing, trips, or holidays, it is unlikely that one member of the family will decide on the purchase by themselves without consulting the other family members.</p>



<p>Maybe you are in the process of buying a costume for yourself and you spot something for your partner, and now is not the time to check his size or her preferred color, so by adding it to a wishlist you know it is saved for later.</p>



<p>A marketplace site that offers days out, sells different experiences for different occasions and locations. These can be saved in a ‚Äòwishlist‚Äô based on the users‚Äô preferences. If someone is planning a trip to Tenerife and for a few months later a trip to Venice, each of the activities can be added to their own list.<br />As a tour operator, it would be a great insight into what the most popular activity is even if most of these activities are not actually bought online.</p>



<p>The wishlist is not just for customers to add a number of products to a favorite list. It allows you to understand the customer‚Äôs needs and really enhance their experience, get more return visits to the site, share products with a wider audience in a more organic way, and get an insight into your customer‚Äôs wishes.<br /><br /></p>



<h2>No plugin needed, create a basic wishlist functionality</h2>



<p><br />We understand that you don‚Äôt necessarily want to add another plugin, but you do want the wishlist functionality. By simply adding the attached code to your theme‚Äôs functions.php you can enable the following features.<br /><br /><div class="yithemes-interview">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-2 col-sm-2 col-xs-3 profile-name">

            <div class="interview-content">
				With the supplied code, you can create a basic wishlist functionality in your WooCommerce store without the need of a plugin. A plugin can greatly enhance the functionality, but if this is not needed then this is just as good.             </div>

<h2>Save time and use the premium version of Wishlist</h2>



<p><br />If you want to save time and want to be able to use or customize every feature without having to use a developer or add custom code, then using the premium version of YITH Wishlist for WooCommerce is the absolute best option. Also, understanding the value it offers by using the mailing features to convert more customers makes is a no-brainer.</p>



<p>It also comes with a ton of other options including some of the following that has not been discussed before in this article.</p>



<ul>
<li>Invite unlogged users to use your wishlist</li>
<li>Ask for an estimate. This can be a great sales tool for certain types of business and in particular service providers or event planners.</li>
<li>Send an email to the customer whenever an item goes on for sale. This will make sure you get instant results when you are holding a sale, even for a very short period.</li>
<li>Additional widgets like a mini overview and Wishlist widgets for Elementor.</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, when you do the maths, it is an easy win to install it yourself and use the documentation to set it up. A developer will charge in excess of $75 per hour and when you add customization on top, this can easily run into several 100 dollars.</p>



<p>What about updates and compatibility?</p>



<p>Yes, using a single author for all your WooCommerce plugins certainly has it‚Äôs advantages as they work well together. Using a reputable company to keep your plugins, and therefore your site, safe and up to date is probably top of your list when you think how much depends on the e-commerce site being online and secure.<br /><br /></p>



<h3>Conclusions for implementing a Wishlist plugin</h3>



<p><br />The commercial value it can bring to your business is immense. When you fully utilize the emailing and notification options, you have a great marketing tool at hand to boost your income.</p>

YITH did not only sponsor it, but we also had two very experienced speakers doing a talk during the event. The state of the WordCamps has completely been turned upside down in recent months since the outbreak of the coronavirus.</p>



<p>As a company, we would have attended over 12 WordCamps by now in 2020 alone. This is sadly not been possible, but out of the dedication from the WordCamp community, something amazing has been happening. Everywhere in the world, you see online events popping up from smaller WordPress Meetup to the grandiose WordCamp Spain Online 2020. And grandiose it was, as it attracted 5500 registrations! The number of people streaming the talk live, you could only dream of in the real world at a physical WordCamp, was astonishing.</p>



<p>The event had two tracks for talks and each had an additional virtual room where attendees could ask questions after the talk was finished. There were also used for some networking. The overall impression from our side was that the Spanish WordCamp community organized an impeccable WordCamp event and we are super proud to have been involved with this online version.</p>

<p>In this talk, Nando shared about the science, and specifically neuroscience, and how it affects the decision-making process in our brains and the stimuli it receives during the phases that precede a purchase, coming to establish that it is mainly emotions that guide decisions.</p>



<p>There are several techniques that can be used to influence or direct purchasing decisions according to the principles of persuasive psychology and cognitive science. In this talk, we will try to see some of them in action and understand how and why they work.</p>

<p>&#8220;More than five thousand people were registered for the event, I don&#8217;t know how many people exactly were live during my speech, I think about 800 people in real-time. It is always a great emotion to talk to so many people, this time it was also a little different and more difficult than usual, not being able to see people, their looks, not being able to interact with them, makes everything different. </p>
<p>A truly meticulous organization, congratulations to all the organizers of this event. Once again the Spanish community has proved to be among the most united and organized in the world.&#8221;            </div>

<h2>So how did we experience it as a sponsor?</h2>



<p>Well, not quite the same as meeting the lovely community in real-life in the hallway track and this is certainly something we can‚Äôt wait to happen again. However, the community-feeling and online experience plus social media made us equally proud to have supported this event. The most amazing part is that it reached so many more people from all over the world.</p>

<p>The WordCamp was organized by 42 co-organizers and headed by Pablo Moratinos and in less than 50 days. We want to give a special shout out to these wonderful volunteers who dedicated their time to organizing this event. Thank you!</p>

<h3>What‚Äôs next in the WordPress events Calendar?</h3>



<p>The great thing about the online summit is that most talks have been recorded and are available on YouTube. The track with Nando‚Äôs talk has around 8000 views already at the time of writing this. This means that so many more people can learn from all the speaker‚Äôs experiences for months to come.</p>



<p>This is the second big online WordPress event we have sponsored with the WPFeedback Live summit the week before WordCamp Spain online. This trend is continuing with <a href="https://2020.europe.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="WordCamp Europe (opens in a new tab)">WordCamp Europe</a> at the beginning of June and with several others that are in the planning stages.</p>



<p>From what we gathered, the Spanish community aims to keep an annual event like this for all Spanish-speakers. We look forward to being involved with many more and share the knowledge with a wide audience while most of the world is getting used to a new way of living for the foreseeable future. It has certainly opened new opportunities.</p>

Having studied Computer Engineering at the University of La Laguna, he found himself developing one of the most popular plugins; YITH WooCommerce Gift Cards, a few years later after being offered a contract.<br />
This journey is really remarkable when you think that over 50,000 shops rely on the development, passion and maintenance that Francisco, with the support of the full team, provides.</p>
<p>The plugin was not originally developed by Francisco which led to some challenges when redesigning the plugin. So we asked about his experience on redesigning the Gift Card plugin</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúYes, version 3.0 of YITH Gift Cards that was fully developed by me and has a lot of improvements and new features that makes it one of the top-selling plugins of our company. Together with Sara, the company&#8217;s UX designer, I was able to set a new standard in design and also code‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>What were the struggles you experienced when completing this project?</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúI found many since the plugin was not developed by me and it is always difficult to work on someone else&#8217;s work. You first need to understand the developer&#8217;s thinking and work habits before you build it up again to the improved company&#8217;s code standards and framework‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>What lessons did you learn from it and what can someone take-away from these lessons?</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúI learned to improve my developer skills when I was stuck at some point, I always found a way to fix it, looking for information on the internet with support of the very helpful WordPress community, asking colleagues, etc. And also learned that in the development, everything is possible, but it depends on your desire and determination‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Francisco has always lived in La Laguna in Tenerife. It is an ancient town a short tram ride away from the capital Santa Cruz where the head office is located.<br />
Having studied at the local university and found his ideal job on what many would describe is the perfect place to live, but like everyone, also Francisco wonders what is beyond the horizon&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúMy passion is travelling, know the culture of the places where I travel, meet local people and eat local food of course <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="üòÄ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px">I don&#8217;t have a specific hobby, but I like to play video games, meet my friends and play table games, stroll through the wonderful places that our island offers us.‚Äù</span></p></blockquote>
<p>If there is one thing Spain and in particular Tenerife is famous for, it is the food‚Ä¶ no surprise then when asked what motivates Francisco and that the favourite moment of the day is ‚Äòlunch‚Äô</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúI really love all the Canarian food ( papas con costillas, ropa vieja, puchero ) but my favorite one is the &#8220;Carne de fiesta&#8221;, a typical food that consisting of small pieces of fried pork, accompanied by fried potatoes and a bit of parsley, really tasty &lt;3‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>We asked Francisco to describe the perfect customer in his experience.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúNot a favourite type of customer, but I&#8217;m really happy when a customer appreciates extra work (a customization for example). This makes me think that I&#8217;m useful to someone, that¬† he or she is not a simple customer but represents a whole company that is making a living and earning money thanks to his e-commerce. Being a tiny part in this process, making it a success is very rewarding to me‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, Francisco added one more thing to all our YITH Customers:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúIn this difficult moments I just can say to all to stay safe and healthy in home, everything will be over soon and we can enjoy our world again.‚Äù</p></blockquote>

With a good store locator you should be able to find your nearest branch and not only that, but also filter it based on your requirements like parking, products and menu selection and washroom facilities for example.</p>
<p>A good store locator is a plugin that our customers have requested many times and that for many various reasons we had to put off.<br />
Yet, during our usability studies and after building our first course about <a href="https://yithemes.com/themes/courses/how-to-build-an-effective-customer-service-area-in-your-e-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to build an effective Customer Service area in your e-commerce</a>, we had the opportunity to analyze hundreds of store locator tools both in big shops (like Ikea, Target, Primark‚Ä¶) and in small companies too. We took note of the strengths and weaknesses of their store locators and highlighted the features that make a store locator for WordPress a really effective instrument for the company and a usable tool for the customer who will interact with it.</p>
<p><em><strong>‚ÄúUsers often combine online and offline purchasing experiences‚Äù</strong></em>. This is the first statement of the video lesson dedicated to the Store locator. And it is true: statistics confirm that <strong>75% of users try to locate a store</strong> even before purchasing a product online, to see if and how long the delivery might be delayed, or if there‚Äôs a brick and mortar store where to test the product or where to give it back if it‚Äôs not good for them.</p>
<p>Information available on Google is often incorrect or outdated: this is why almost every user prefers using the store locator of the company website.</p>
<p>A store locator that works well and fast conveys reliability and improves the user experience of your website. With this in mind, we have designed and developed <strong>one of the best store locator plugins for WordPress</strong>.</p>

<p>A must-have solution that those businesses, shops or offices that intend to help customers spot the available locations must absolutely integrate into their website.</p>
<p>The plugin includes all the most important functionalities of a textbook store locator. But which ones exactly? Let‚Äôs find them out.<br />

<h1>1. Automatic geolocation and geolocation option</h1>
<p><a href="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-geolocation-700.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1123572 aligncenter" src="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-geolocation-700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="371" srcset="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-geolocation-700.jpg 700w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-geolocation-700-300x159.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-geolocation-700-500x265.jpg 500w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-geolocation-700-440x233.jpg 440w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-geolocation-700-261x138.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-geolocation-700-311x165.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-geolocation-700-363x192.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-geolocation-700-270x143.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a>One of the most popular features is by no doubt the geolocation: it gives the website permission to locate the user‚Äôs position automatically and return targeted and real-time information, without wasting time with typing the city or address in the search form.</p>
<p>The plugin includes two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic geolocation, which asks users for permissions to find their position automatically as soon as they access the store locator page.</li>
<li>The geolocation, a text link or a button on which users can click as an alternative to the standard search.</li>
</ul>

<h1>2. Instant search</h1>
<p><a href="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-instant-search-700.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1123573 aligncenter" src="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-instant-search-700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="459" srcset="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-instant-search-700.jpg 700w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-instant-search-700-300x197.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-instant-search-700-500x328.jpg 500w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-instant-search-700-440x289.jpg 440w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-instant-search-700-261x171.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-instant-search-700-311x204.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-instant-search-700-363x238.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-instant-search-700-270x177.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>What if the user does not want to be geolocalized? No worries, we‚Äôve just made the search process as easy and intuitive as possible by activating the instant search. This means that if users start typing the first letters of the city where they want to find the shop, they will get search suggestions immediately. Results are updated in real time as you type: so you can choose one of the suggested options and be spared the trouble of typing the full address or town name.</p>
<p>This helps <strong>saving time, reducing efforts</strong> and <strong>minimizing typing errors</strong> that could compromise the outcome or show wrong results based on inexistent postcodes or an address not found because of a missing letter, just to mention a few.<br />

<h1>3. The possibility to create countless stores</h1>

<p>YITH Store Locator for WordPress is a perfect solution, whether you have just one point of sale or you have 300. You can create as many Stores as you need (we call them Stores, but it can also be offices, branches etc) and set up different information for each of them: a picture of the shop, a description, contact information, opening hours and address.<br />
Moreover, you can highlight some of the stores (with a different background color and a ‚ÄúFeatured‚Äù badge on them) and choose your favourite layout for the store detail page (that users can reach by clicking on the Store name, unless you disable this option).<br />
    <div class="spacer" style="height: 50px;"></div>
	</p>
<h1>4. The possibility to create countless filters for your stores</h1>
<p><a href="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-filters-850.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1123555 aligncenter" src="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-filters-850.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="521" srcset="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-filters-850.jpg 850w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-filters-850-300x184.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-filters-850-768x471.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-filters-850-500x306.jpg 500w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-filters-850-440x270.jpg 440w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-filters-850-261x160.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-filters-850-311x191.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-filters-850-363x222.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/store-locator-filters-850-270x165.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></a></p>
<p>If you have many shops where you offer different services (e.g. free parking, children area, returns and changes, home delivery and so on) or where you find a specific product stock (like the Disney section at Primark, which is only available in some branches, or the vegan menu, which is only available in some McDonald‚Äôs restaurants), you‚Äôll certainly need to create filters to let users find out which shop/point of sale/office is the most suitable one.</p>
<p>You can create any kind of filters and choose whether to use the ‚Äúcheckbox‚Äù option (and allow users to select multiple stores at the same time) or ‚Äúselect‚Äù option (and let the user pick only one at a time). Additionally, you can choose whether to show them open on the page or wrap them in an expandable menu: the ideal solution for pleasant look and good usability, especially when you have many filters to show.<br />

<p>It‚Äôs right in such a complicated moment that we could complete the update of one of our most popular plugins: we‚Äôre happy to announce that <strong>version 2.0</strong> of our Catalog Mode plugin is already available online.<br />
    <div class="spacer" style="height: 50px;"></div>
	</p>
<h1>What‚Äôs new in this 2.0 version?</h1>
<h2>A new UX and UI for a positive user experience</h2>
<p><a href="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cambioUX.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1121098" src="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cambioUX.jpg" alt="" width="1624" height="1142" srcset="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cambioUX.jpg 1624w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cambioUX-300x211.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cambioUX-1024x720.jpg 1024w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cambioUX-768x540.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cambioUX-1536x1080.jpg 1536w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cambioUX-500x352.jpg 500w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cambioUX-440x309.jpg 440w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cambioUX-261x184.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cambioUX-311x219.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cambioUX-363x255.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cambioUX-270x190.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 1624px) 100vw, 1624px" /></a></p>
<p>We have totally redesigned the UX of the plugin panel to make it more usable and user-friendly.<br />
Some of the options were quite obscure and difficult to understand, so we started with a complex analysis of the admin panel aiming at elaborating the several available settings in a new way. Now we are pretty sure that even users with basic technical skills are able to set advanced rules for their products and understand the behaviour of the well-known ‚ÄúExclusion list‚Äù <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>It‚Äôs been one year now since we started a code refactoring of all our plugins. We took advantage of this update to optimize the code of YITH Catalog Mode and make it even more performing.</p>

<h2>Added compatibility with Formidable Forms and Ninja Form plugins</h2>
<p><a href="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/inquiryform.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1121099" src="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/inquiryform.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1504" srcset="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/inquiryform.jpg 2000w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/inquiryform-300x226.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/inquiryform-1024x770.jpg 1024w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/inquiryform-768x578.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/inquiryform-1536x1155.jpg 1536w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/inquiryform-500x376.jpg 500w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/inquiryform-440x331.jpg 440w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/inquiryform-261x196.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/inquiryform-311x234.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/inquiryform-363x273.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/inquiryform-270x203.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a></p>
<p>In this latest update we have added compatibility with two more plugins that can be used for the inquiry form: <strong>Ninja Forms and Formidable Forms</strong>, that are added to Gravity Forms and Contact Forms 7, which could already be used.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve also added the possibility to set where the enquiry form shows up (in a dedicated tab or below the product short description) and to show the form either open or in a toggle button that will open only when you click on it.</p>
<p>We have added a buttons &amp; labels builder so you can create unlimited textual labels (of any style and color, with icons, custom images etc.) and buttons of any shape, type and color. Every button or label can be associated with all the products or just to specific products, with the utmost ease.</p>

<h2>We have added a powerful buttons &amp; labels builder</h2>

<p>As of today, with the previous version of Catalog Mode, you could only <em>create one custom button</em> that would replace the product price and the Add to Cart button.</p>
<p>Yet, from this new version, and this is without a doubt the most interesting new feature, the <strong>Buttons &amp; Label builder</strong> that we‚Äôve implemented allows <strong>creating an unlimited number of buttons and text labels</strong>, of any size, style, shape and colour.</p>
<p>You really have unlimited possibilities: you can create a custom button to ask users to register so they can see prices, encourage users to contact you by phone or fill in a form to get a dedicated price estimate. Every button or label can be associated with all products or just some of them, with absolute versatility.</p>
<p>We invite you to go on a tour on the new <a href="http://plugins.yithemes.com/yith-woocommerce-catalog-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Live demo &gt;</strong></a>¬†and take a look at the new option panel thanks to the ‚ÄúLaunch admin demo‚Äù function.</p>

<h2>Why was the Proteo Theme developed?</h2>
<p>YITH developers decided to create a new and lightweight theme that would be compatible to test with all of our plugins. This then evolved into a theme that was actually looking good and easy to use. The idea was to make this available to all our users and anyone who would want to use it. The design and functionality of the new theme evolved since September 2019, with the first version available to download from GitHub in December 2019. Unfortunately, it took a few months to get it approved, mainly due to a backlog from the WordPress theme review team. But we‚Äôd like to thank @basantakumar, @ideagrafica and @franchidesign for supporting the process.</p>
<p>The theme was designed by our talented UX/UI designer, Sara Presenti, and developed by Francesco Grasso with support from the rest of the YITH team. The first users could also add feedback and improvement ideas to Github. But thanks to Francesco‚Äôs dedication and determination to the project he saw it through to the end with much success.</p>

<h2>What is Proteo Theme?</h2>
<p>A theme is like the jacket of your website. Not every jacket fits well and each jacket is better suited for different activities. You wouldn‚Äôt go running in a dinner jacket, would you? Although it might fit, it will not be the most comfortable. It is the same for a theme, you find the best style and features that help your website perform better.<br />
Just by installing and activating Proteo, you instantly have something that feels and looks good for an e-commerce website. With some adjustments, you can start selling with confidence in hours. The theme is optimised to work with a number of key plugins like <a href="https://yithemes.com/themes/plugins/yith-woocommerce-wishlist/">YITH WooCommerce Wishlist</a> and <a href="https://yithemes.com/themes/plugins/yith-woocommerce-ajax-search-subscription/">YITH WooCommerce Ajax search</a>, giving some great e-commerce functionality to your shop.</p>

<h3>Free and easy to download from WordPress</h3>
<p>Easy it is as all you need to do is go to the themes submenu under appearance and search for Proteo. Once installed and activated you are ready‚Ä¶ you will be surprised how quickly you feel ready to start selling.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_1118436" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1118436" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-1118436 size-full" src="https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/proteo-theme-01-e1585233294348.png" alt="" width="800" height="458" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1118436" class="wp-caption-text">Search for &#8216;Proteo&#8217; from Themes under Appearance</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>

<h2>Creating Child Themes with Proteo</h2>
<p>The longterm plan is to bring out different styles of Proteo, in the form of child themes. These might include styles that work well with an auction site and one that looks better for multivendor or market places.</p>
<p>It is commonly known that when you update themes it can override your changes. Using the customizer will not override these, but if you add PHP or other code to your theme files, there is a good chance that these will be lost after the next theme update. If you are planning to add code to the theme files, we recommend you <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">take a look here &gt;</a></p>
